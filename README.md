## Devlogs

### W1

Write your W1 activity Devlog here.

### W2

Create future Devlog sub-headers with the three # symbols, then write your Devlogs below them.

## W3

**Class Activity(Table 1):**

**1**

bool whether\_Hit(float Finger\_Hit, folat Finger\_Leave){

 	bool hit = Mathf.abs(Finger\_Hit - Should\_Hit) <= 0.1 \&\& Mathf.abs(Finger\_Leave - Should\_Leave) <= 0.1;

 	return hit;

}

//Finger\_Hit, Finger\_Leave is the time when player's finger hits or leaves the screen, and Should\_Hit and Should\_Leave are values that are the precise time that player should touch the screen.

2 Mono blahblah questions

(1) a class is a blueprint and a component is the thing made from the blueprint.

(2) the RGB values approaches 1, and (1, 1, 1) is white
